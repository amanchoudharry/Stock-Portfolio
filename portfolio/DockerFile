# Step 1: Build the application
FROM maven:3.8.4-openjdk-17 AS build

# Set the working directory in the build container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the pom.xml to the working directory
COPY portfolio/pom.xml .

# Download the dependencies offline (this will cache dependencies in the Docker layer)
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline

# Copy the source code to the container
COPY portfolio/src ./src

# Package the application (skip tests to speed up the build process)
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Step 2: Create the runtime container
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory in the runtime container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file from the build container to the runtime container
COPY --from=build /app/target/portfolio-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

# Expose the port your app will run on (adjust if needed)
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the JAR file
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
